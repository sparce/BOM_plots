# Plotting BOM data

Here are some example solutions for the 
[Data School challenge](https://csiro-data-school.github.io/visualisation/04-theming/index.html#challenge-putting-it-all-together) 
on visualisation. The challenge asks us to plot weather measurements from several sites across
Australia as a way of practising visualisation using the ggplot2.

## Cloning the project

To test out these examples, you can clone this repository in RStudio:

  * Create a new RStudio project (File menu > New Project)
  * Select the 'Version Control' option to checkout this existing project
  * From the next menu, select 'Git' as the type of repository
  * Paste in the URL for this repository (`https://github.com/sparce/BOM_plots.git`)
  * Check that you are happy with the project's name and directory, then select 'Create Project'
  
## Files

The code for all plots can be found in the `BOM_analysis.R` file. This file includes code from the [previous](https://csiro-data-school.github.io/r/15-Reproducibility/index.html#challenge-putting-it-all-together) Data School challenge used to import and tidy the data ready for plotting.

The plots have been saved to the `figures` directory, but are also saved as variables to be explored interactively or modified after running the script.
